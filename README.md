# *Eclipse Phase 2e Character Options* compendium content for Bubz's EP2 Foundry VTT system

This Foundry VTT module provides compendium content from the *Character Options* splatbook for Posthuman Studios'
tabletop role playing game, *Eclipse Phase* Second Edition (EP2). This content is for use with Bubz's [EP2 game
system][bubz-ep2e-github] for Foundry VTT.

This content is available to you thanks to the generosity of Posthuman Studios, who have graciously provided it under
the permissive CC BY-NC-SA license. All creative credit for it goes to them.

If you find this module useful, please [buy me a coffee or two][mikenerone-ko-fi] to show your support! I drink plenty
of it. And support Posthuman Studios and the other folks whose work this builds on via the links below!

## Technical Note
Bubz's `ep2e` game system, for which this module is an expansion, is currently undergoing a rewrite that will greatly
expand its capabilities in the near future. The *current* release is completely usable, but there are a few rule
structures that it's not yet able to model properly. These constraints affect the content of this model in a few ways:
1. Core morphs are modeled as `Vehicle/Spaceship` synthmorphs. This is sufficient to capture all of their stats, but
results in a few inapplicable stats being displayed for them, as well.
2. A few morph wares are not attached, and are reflected as notes in the morph descriptions instead.
3. FlexBots cannot be modelled in a helpful way, so content related to them is excluded.
